# ROS2-PointCloud
Used RTAB mapping, a powerful technique for creating accurate 3D maps using RGB-D cameras
Used  the Kitti Dataset and explore how to use 3D lidars for object detection
Performed techniques for detecting  objects in real-time, such as lidar-based segmentation and clustering
Used ROS2, to learn how to use rviz and PCL to create visualizations and analyze your point cloud data with ease. In addition, use explore cylindrical and planar segmentation,  for extracting meaningful information from point cloud data.
